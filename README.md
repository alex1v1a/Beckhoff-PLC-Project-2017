Beckhoff-PLC-Project-2017

### TWINCAT (Alex Server)  

You can use the [this link](http://gofile.me/27IN6/7Uf7CWD8H) to download the files for Beckhoffs' TWINCAT software.

Please install and check out the TWINCAT software, I’ve provided a link to my server above for direct download so you don't need to make an account. Will be easy if they ask us questions.

### ETHERCAT

We also will need to know what exactly ETHERCAT protocol is and how it is implemented.

### Research

We need some key points of what **sensors** we are likely to use and why, comparing some of the ones to use with the industry now. This could be like we are making sensors for an airconditioning unit so we have researched IR, and TEMP, and HUMIDITY sensors and we have these types of sensors available and we have chosen to go with these types X for TEMP, Y for HUMIDITY, and will not use Z for IR because not necessary as we only need 2 sensors because that is the current fail safe standard for this application etc.

The second half will be to figure out how to get the software to host the data then live stream remotely to the client side app, which will be android based, or iOS I don’t mind, almost the same programming only you need a mac for the C++ in XCODE and a $100 developer account so probs ok just to use android, I have no idea on these apps but should be relatively straightforward as we can provide the host address and stream the data direct… I’m not exactly sure on how to get the input back so have a look at that and see what you can find.
